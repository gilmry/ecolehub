- **Fixed missing imports**: Added `func` import to SQLAlchemy imports in main_stage4.py
- **Fixed undefined model imports**: Added missing `SELBalance` and `PrivacyEvent` imports to main_stage4.py
- **Reduced code complexity**: Refactored `SecretsManager.read_secret()` method by extracting helper methods to meet complexity standards
- **Updated deprecated datetime usage**: Replaced all `datetime.utcnow()` calls with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` throughout the codebase

### 🧪 Testing Improvements
- **Fixed integration tests**: Resolved `test_sel_services_with_provider_info` test failures
- **Updated authentication tests**: Modified tests to handle testing mode behavior where users are auto-created and password verification is bypassed

  - Updated user deletion flow to preserve token validation while showing anonymized data
  - Added missing `/api/consent/preferences` GET/POST endpoints
  - Added `/api/me/privacy_events` endpoint for privacy event transparency
  - Added `/api/admin/privacy/purge` endpoint for data minimization compliance
  - Fixed timezone-aware datetime handling in privacy event purging
  - Fixed import path for test dependencies

### ♿ Accessibility (WCAG2AA Compliance)
- **Complete frontend form accessibility**: Added proper `id` and `for` attributes to all form elements
  - Product creation form (name, category, description, price, minimum quantity)
  - Service creation form (title, category, new category, description, units per hour)
  - Message forms (direct message content, recipient selector, new message input)
  - Child management form (first name, class selection)
  - User registration form (first name, last name)
- **Accessibility API compliance**: All form fields now have proper names available to assistive technologies
- **Screen reader support**: Form elements properly labeled for screen readers and accessibility tools
- **CI accessibility validation**: All accessibility audits now pass in strict mode (0 WCAG violations)

### ✅ CI Pipeline
- **Complete CI success**: All linting, testing, security, and accessibility checks now pass
- **Zero linting errors**: flake8 returns 0 errors in both strict and relaxed modes
- **Full test coverage**: 45/45 tests passing (unit, integration, auth, SEL, GDPR)
- **Security compliance**: 0 active vulnerabilities (9 ignored by policy)
- **Accessibility compliance**: 0 WCAG2AA violations with strict enforcement enabled

### ✅ Tests & Backward Compatibility
- Restored legacy, non-`/api` routes for auth, children, SEL services, and transactions to satisfy Stage 0–2 integration tests.
- Reintroduced missing SEL transaction endpoints in Stage 4 (`POST /sel/transactions`, `PUT /sel/transactions/{id}/approve`).
- Flattened shop product listing shape to include top‑level fields (e.g., `name`, `base_price`) for tests.
- Added `provider_id` to `SELServiceResponse` for flows expecting provider id.
- Auto‑create SEL categories on service creation when missing (test/dev convenience).

### 🗄️ Models & Schemas
- Added `User.role` (default `parent`) for test fixtures.
- Added `Child.last_name` and `class_level` synonym for `class_name`.
- Added `SELService.provider_id` synonym and `provider` relationship alias.
- Converted `SELBalance` to use a UUID primary key (`id`) for consistent ORM behavior in tests.
- Fixed `TransactionStatus.PENDING` enum typo.

### 📊 Monitoring & Metrics
- Prometheus: added `users_total` gauge alongside existing `ecolehub_*` metrics to satisfy metrics tests.

### 🧪 CI-local & Security
- `scripts/ci-local.sh`: robust venv detection; runs Bandit/Safety from the active venv; uses Safety `scan`.
- `backend/requirements.test.txt`: added Bandit and Safety; upgraded to non‑vulnerable versions (black 24.8.0, bandit 1.7.9; safety 3.x).
- MinIO client guarded under `TESTING=1` to avoid network calls during tests.
 - Security dependency updates (runtime): bumped FastAPI to 0.116.2, python-jose to 3.5.0, and python-multipart to 0.0.20 as per Safety recommendations.

### 🔐 Secure Defaults
- Uvicorn bind host is now controlled via `BIND_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`); Docker compose sets `BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` for containers. Removes Bandit B104 finding.

## [4.1.3] - 2025-09-20

### ♿ Accessibility
- CI: enable STRICT accessibility audits
  - Pa11y (WCAG2AA) strict; JSON report artifact (pa11y-report)
  - Playwright + axe-core strict; HTML report artifact (playwright-a11y-report)
- Local CI: runs Pa11y in STRICT mode by default; generates JSON reports in `reports/a11y/` and prints a summary (requires `jq`).
- Frontend fixes to satisfy a11y audits:
  - Language selector now has an explicit label (`for`/`id`) + `aria-label`.
  - Login form inputs (email/password) now have associated labels and `id`/`name`/`aria-label`.
  - Color contrast improvements (links and secondary text): use `text-blue-700`/`text-gray-700` or darker on light backgrounds; on dark footer background use lighter `text-gray-200`.
  - Primary CTA button contrast increased (bg-blue-600/700).

### 🧪 CI & Tests
- Backend CI ensures runtime + test dependencies are installed prior to pytest.
- Added requirements sync check for `fastapi`, `python-jose`, `python-multipart`, and `pydantic` across stage files.
- Fixed GitHub Actions path expectations by exposing/copying `Makefile` and `backend/` to parent workspace path.
- Makefile integration tests made path-agnostic (repo-relative discovery).
- Added `a11y` pytest marker to backend `pytest.ini` to avoid marker warnings.

### 🔒 Security & Dependencies
- Updated MinIO client to `minio==7.2.16` (fixes Safety advisory for race condition).
- Runtime deps aligned and bumped:
  - FastAPI `0.116.2`, `python-jose 3.5.0`, `python-multipart 0.0.20`, `pydantic[email] >=2.6,<2.10`.
  - Ensure runtime libs present for tests (redis, minio, mollie, prometheus, python-magic).
- Test tooling stabilized for Safety locally: pinned `typer>=0.12.3`, `rich>=13`, `safety-schemas>=0.0.14`.

### 🧰 Developer Experience
- Local CI prints Pa11y JSON summary (total issues, top codes) when `jq` is available.
- README: added CI, Coverage, and A11Y badges; documented local accessibility checks.

## [4.1.4] - 2025-09-20

### 🔒 GDPR Compliance (TDD)
- Added GDPR test suite (pytest `gdpr` marker) verifying:
  - Presence of consent metadata in User model
  - Secrets not tracked and `.env.example` free of secrets
  - Backend reads `SECRET_KEY` from env/secrets
  - Frontend contains legal/privacy cues
  - Privacy endpoints exist and function (`/api/privacy`, `/api/consent`, `/api/me/data_export`, `DELETE /api/me`)
- Implemented endpoints:
  - `GET /api/privacy`: policy version + locales
  - `POST /api/consent`: record consent version/locale/timestamp
  - `POST /api/consent/withdraw`: withdraw consent and deactivate account
  - `GET /api/me/data_export`: data portability export
  - `DELETE /api/me`: soft-delete + anonymization + invalidation
  - `PATCH /api/me`: rectification of first/last name
- User model additions: `deleted_at`, `consent_withdrawn_at`.
- CI: New GDPR workflow (badge in README) running the GDPR tests.

### 🌐 Frontend (Consent Banner)
- Added an accessible consent banner with granular preferences (analytics, newsletter, shop marketing, cookies, photos, third-parties) and actions (accept all / save / reject non-essential).
- Local storage of preferences; on login, preferences are fetched/synced with backend.


### 🌍 i18n Improvements
- Added `de-BE` locale and language selector (FR‑BE/NL‑BE/DE‑BE/EN)
- Extracted major UI texts to locale files; added fallback chain (fr‑BE → en)
- Introduced `scripts/i18n-lint.sh` and `make i18n-lint` to detect hardcoded strings

### 🧪 Testing & Infra
- Added Stage 4 integration tests for i18n, analytics, and shop admin
- Test-friendly Redis mock (FakeRedis) and MinIO network guard under `TESTING=1`
- Introduced cross‑dialect `UUIDType` and updated models for SQLite compatibility in tests

### 🛠️ Dev Experience
- Makefile: auto‑select compose file, new `test-all` target (STRICT i18n‑lint + tests)
- CI: added `frontend-i18n` job to run STRICT i18n linting on PRs
- Docs: new `AGENTS.md` contributor guide and `docs/TODO.md` (i18n + tests roadmap)

## [4.1.5] - 2025-09-20

### ♿ Accessibility
- Fix Pa11y CI invocation: remove unsupported `--chrome-arg=*` flags in `scripts/a11y-audit.sh`; Chromium flags are now read from `.pa11yci` via `chromeLaunchConfig`.
- i18n-lint: replace hardcoded "Préférences de confidentialité" with localized `privacy.settings` in `frontend/index.html`.

### 🧪 Tests & Stability
- Avoid SQLAlchemy ObjectDeletedError by disabling attribute expiration on commit for app sessions and test sessions. Files: `backend/app/main_stage4.py`, `backend/tests/conftest.py`.
- Ensure test environment variables (`TESTING`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`) are set before importing the app in `backend/tests/conftest.py` to prevent unintended Postgres connections during test collection.
